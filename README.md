## Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

This project creates high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills.A special attention is given to data quality when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse, tests are run against Sparkfy' datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and is processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## Datasets 
We have two datasets on S3
`Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data ` 
`Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
